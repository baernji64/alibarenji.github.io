                        <h3>Statement of Teaching</h3>
                            <p style="font-size: small;">I hear, and I forget, I see, and I remember, I do, and I understand. ~ Confucius,</p>

                    <p style="font-size: medium; font-weight: 100;">My enthusiasm and commitment to teaching are equal to my commitment to research because I envision teaching and mentoring as an integral part of my career profile. During the past years, I have had the opportunity to advise and train people at various levels, leading to rewarding feedback for my research and teaching work. Teaching allows me to promote the discipline to which I have devoted a significant portion of my life and show people the beauty of computation in science,
                         technology, and mathematics. I have taught at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. In my opinion, teaching is one of the most enjoyable ways to engage in a lifelong learning experience and to discover inner potential. It can provide a unique opportunity to share knowledge and experience the free exchange of ideas in a conducive atmosphere. As Will Durant rightly said, “Education is the progressive discovery of our ignorance.”

                        The best teachers possess a unique ability to gently awaken and transform our assumptions and beliefs about the world around us. They awaken a sense of joy, creation, and innovation. They challenge us; they make us believe; they inspire a sense of inquiry, and they bring a sense of meaning and importance to our personal experiences. They inspire us to create positive change and motivate us to be better and to do better.
As a researcher in the engineering field, it is my responsibility to play a role in discovering new knowledge. As a teacher, I believe an even greater responsibility is perpetuating the field and current knowledge body. Teaching allows me to promote the discipline to which I have devoted a significant portion of my life and show people the beauty of computation in science, technology, and mathematics. Based on my experiences through my own teaching experiences and attendance at several workshops, conferences, and online certifications programs, I have learned that there are multiple approaches to improve teaching and learning in higher education; that a commitment to learner-centeredness is of most importance. Each teaching experience is unique from instructor to instructor, semester to semester, discipline to discipline, course to course, and even from day to day. 
My teaching philosophy is based on my educational and life experience. I personally learned through action, experience, discovery, and exploration. Therefore, I strongly believe that learning through experience is the best teaching strategy and is one of the most fundamental and natural means of learning which is available to everyone. I always try to develop my teaching strategy and methodology based on this approach. My teaching strategies are most informed by experiential and collaborative learning, peer development, critical inquiry, discussion, and a clear focus on student autonomy and learning responsibility. I mainly follow the simplicity theory of experiential learning and the authenticity embedded within critical reflection and transformative learning theories. I design my course syllabus in a way to encourage students to discover and apply new methods through a cycle of experience, awareness, and transformation.  
Successful experiential learning requires just the right amount of structure to manage the complexities of open-ended and real-world situations while helping students navigate their requirements and ambiguities. In my courses, I educate students on numerous ways to enhance their motivation to participate and pursue academic research. In my classes, I always try my best to focus on students’ learning and adjust my teaching strategies in response to the pace and depth of student understanding. To this end, I try to motivate them to focus on learning rather than passing a course. When students focus their energy through their attention on learning while optimizing effort, grades are a natural result of this effective learning process. To this end, in the first sessions of my classes, I clearly explain my teaching strategy.
I mostly act as a facilitator and allow students to express their ideas freely. In the first two weeks of my classes, I ask my students to contact me and identify their research interests and desired projects. Then, I will try my best to provide them with some guidelines and relevant resources and help them throughout this route to achieve their goals. I allow them to experiment and discover solutions on their own, but I am always ready to answer their questions if they need my help. 
I always try to make fair use of technology and real-life examples in my classrooms to make learning more enjoyable. I believe using technology has many benefits. Technology can encourage active participation in the classroom, which is also a very important factor for increased knowledge retention. Technology provides excellent opportunities for making learning more effective for everyone with different needs. For example, students can learn at their speed, review difficult concepts, or skip ahead if they need to. Moreover, technology can provide more opportunities for struggling or disabled students. Finally, Students can practice collaboration skills by getting involved in different online activities, such as working on different projects by collaborating with others on forums or sharing documents in their virtual learning environments. Technology can encourage collaboration with students in the same classroom, same school, and even with other classrooms worldwide.
Overall, as a teacher, I am continually striving to maximize my potential outside of my teaching classroom to learn new strategies to create meaningful lesson plans and help students learn and enjoy my courses. I aim to develop qualified students who can use what they have learned in their real life, be confident enough to talk in public, and not be afraid of making mistakes.
